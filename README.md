# Breast-Cancer-detection-using-Deep-learning

I undertook a mission to enhance breast cancer detection using deep learning methodologies. The aim was to revolutionize the diagnostic process, reducing dependency on invasive biopsies and empowering clinicians with more efficient tools. Over the course of a month, I worked solo, leveraging state-of-the-art neural network architectures like ResNet and EfficientNet. The project involved meticulous data preprocessing, organizing spatial coordinates, and integrating transfer learning for accurate cancer prediction. I analyzed histopathological images, extracting and visualizing cancerous regions, culminating in a model boasting an 86% accuracy rate. The highlight was the development of a user-friendly visualization tool, enabling healthcare professionals to interpret predictive probabilities and pinpoint potential cancerous regions swiftly. This project exemplified my dedication to leveraging deep learning for impactful healthcare solutions, achieving substantial strides in breast cancer detection within a relatively short timeframe.
